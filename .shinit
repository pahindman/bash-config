# .pam_environment sets ENV to point at this file, which means that this file
# will get sourced when the 'sh' is interactive.  Bash normally only sources ENV
# when it is in 'posix' mode or has been invoked as 'sh', but my .bashrc will
# always source $ENV.

# I use this file to hold any non-bash specific items that I want done for every
# interactive shell, even non-login shells.  For example, settings that cannot or
# should not be inherited.  Variables that I want to allow this shell instance to
# inherit from its parent should not be set here; default values for overridable
# variables can be set in .profile.
