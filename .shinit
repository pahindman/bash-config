# .profile sets ENV to point at this file, which means that it will get sourced
# when the 'sh' is interactive.  Bash normally only sources ENV when it is in
# 'posix' mode or has been invoked as 'sh', but my .bashrc will always source
# $ENV.

# I use this file to hold any non-bash specific items that I want done for every
# interactive shell.  Variables that we want to allow this shell instance to
# inherit from its parent should not be set here; default values for overridable
# variables can be set in .profile.
